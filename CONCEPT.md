# Student Attendance and Engagement Tracking

## Description: 
Many educational institutions struggle with tracking student attendance and engagement, especially in large lecture-style classes. This can result in lower student performance and difficulties in identifying students who need extra support. To address this issue, you can create a Python-based software solution to track student attendance and engagement more effectively.

## Proposed Solution: 
Python Application for Attendance and Engagement Tracking

This is a Python-based Application for Attendance and Engagement Tracking. Its purpose is to track student attendance and engagement more efficiently, especilly in large lecture-style classes

is should have the following Key Features:

1. User Authentication: Implement a secure login system for instructors and students.

2. Course Management: Allow instructors to create and manage courses, add students, and set up class schedules.

3. QR Code Attendance: Generate QR codes for each class session. Instructors can display these codes at the beginning of the class, and students can scan them using a mobile app. This records their attendance for that session.

4. Attendance Analytics: Provide instructors with real-time attendance data and engagement metrics, such as the number of questions asked, participation in discussions, etc.

5. Notifications: Send automated notifications to students with low attendance or engagement to encourage them to participate more actively.

6. Reports: Generate attendance reports for administrative purposes, which can be useful for monitoring and improving student performance.

Implementation Plan:

Week 1:
- Define the database schema for storing user information, courses, sessions, and attendance records.
- Create a basic user authentication system.
- Develop a web-based front-end for user registration and course management.

Week 2:
- Implement QR code generation for each class session.
- Develop the mobile app for students to scan QR codes and record their attendance.
- Connect the mobile app to the server for data synchronization.

Week 3:
- Implement real-time attendance tracking and engagement metrics.
- Add notifications and alert features for instructors and students.
- Begin work on attendance reports and analytics.

Week 4:
- Finalize attendance reports and analytics.
- Test the system thoroughly for bugs and issues.
- Prepare documentation and a user guide for instructors and students.
